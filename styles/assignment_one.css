    /* If for tablets you wanted to make the monkey line up use this code
    
    Makes a grid so that it stays lined up even if it is "odd" or even"
    note to self: the monkey pic was big compared to the others, this puts it into rows
    so even if it is in rows of three or 2 and theres not enough cards to occupy it will
    stil leave a empty spot or fill it up without changing image size
    The code:
    .card-container {
     display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); Two columns and will take up equal space 
        grid-gap: 20px; 
    }

     makes all images the same size
    .card img {
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }

    makes the last card line up with other and leave empty space, just to make sure the
    monkey stays the same size, not sure if it actually does anything
    .card:last-child {
        grid-column: span 2; Make it span two columns 
    }
}
